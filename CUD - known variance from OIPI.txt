I think my stuff about MLEs is both complete and does not introduce protocol changes. But I'm not sure - I tried to re-write for clarity. Please review this area carefully.

I intentionally left out the content in section 2.2.7.3.8 Update Request Containing a Customizable Feed Property Mapping.

Check that I always indicated the required success response from the server (status code and body).

Related to the above, I indicated that other HTTP success codes could be used if they were more specific (eg, for async processing). Is this true?
