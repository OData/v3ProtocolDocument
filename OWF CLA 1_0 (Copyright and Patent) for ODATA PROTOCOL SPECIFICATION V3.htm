This <span style='background:white'>CLA s</span>ets forth the terms under which
I will participate in and contribute to the development of the Specification.
Capitalized terms are defined in the CLA’s last section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:0in'>2. <u>Copyrights</u>. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:.5in'>2.1. <u>Copyright Grant</u>. I grant to you a perpetual (for
the duration of the applicable copyright), worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
royalty-free, copyright license, without any obligation for accounting to me,
to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
sublicense, distribute, and implement any Contribution to the full extent of my
copyright interest in the Contribution. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:.5in'>2.2. <u>Attribution</u>. As a condition of the copyright
grant, you must include an attribution to the Specification in any derivative
work you make based on the Specification. That attribution must include, at
minimum, the Specification name and version number. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:0in'>3. <u>Patents</u>. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:.5in'>3.1. <u>Patent Non-Assert</u>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:1.0in'>3.1.1. <u>The Promise</u>. I, on behalf of myself and my
successors in interest and assigns, irrevocably promise not to assert my
Granted Claims against you for your Permitted Uses, subject to the terms and
conditions of Section 3.1. This is a personal promise directly from me to you,
and you acknowledge as a condition of benefiting from it that no rights from me
are received from suppliers, distributors, or otherwise in connection with this
promise<span style='background:white'>. This promise also applies to your Permitted
Uses of any other specifications incorporating all required portions of the
Specification. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:1.0in'>3.1.2. <u>Termination</u>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:1.5in'>3.1.2.1. <u>As a Result of Claims by You</u>. All rights,
grants, and promises made by me to you under this CLA are terminated if you
file, maintain, or voluntarily participate in a lawsuit against me or any
person or entity asserting that its Permitted Uses infringe any Granted Claims
you would have had the right to enforce had you signed this CLA, unless that
suit was in response to a corresponding suit first brought against you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:1.5in'>3.1.2.2. <u>As a Result of Claims by a Related Entity of
Mine</u>. If a Related Entity of mine files, maintains, or voluntarily
participates in a lawsuit asserting that a Permitted Use infringes any Granted
Claims it would have had the right to enforce had it signed this CLA, then I
relinquish any rights, grants, and promises I have received for the
Specification from other signatories of this CLA, unless a) my promise to you
was terminated pursuant to section 3.1.2.1, or b) that suit was in response to
a corresponding suit first brought by you against the Related Entity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:1.0in'>3.1.3. <u>Additional Conditions</u>. This promise is not an
assurance (i) that any of my copyrights or issued patent claims cove<span
style='background:white'>r an implementation of the Specification or are
enforceable or (ii) that an implementation of the Specification would not
infringe intellectual property rights of any third party. Notwithstanding the
personal nature of my promise, </span>this promise is intended to be binding on
any future owner, assignee or exclusive licensee who has been given the right
to enforce any Granted Claims against third parties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:1.0in'>3.1.4. <u>Bankruptcy</u>. Solely for purposes of Section
365(n) of Title 11, United States Bankruptcy Code and any equivalent law in any
foreign jurisdiction, this promise will be treated as if it were a license and
you may elect to retain your rights under this promise if I (or any owner of
any patents or patent applications referenced herein), as a debtor in
possession, or a bankruptcy trustee, reject this non-assert.</p>

style='background:white'>In addition to rights granted in 3.1, </span>on behalf
of me and my successors in interest and assigns, I agree to grant to you a no
charge, royalty free license to my Granted Claims on reasonable and
non-discriminatory terms, where such license applies only to those Granted
Claims infrin<span style='background:white'>ged by the implementation of my Con</span>tribution(s)
alone or by combination of my Contribution(s) with the Specification, solely
for your Permitted Uses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:0in'><span style='background:white'>4. <u>No Other Rights</u>.
Except as specifically set forth in this CLA, no other express or implied
patent, trademark, copyright, or other property rights are granted under this
CLA, including by implication, waiver, or estoppel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:0in'>5. <u>Limited Opt-Out</u>. I may withdraw my Contribution by
providing written notice of that withdrawal within 45 days of submitting that
Contribution. Notice of a Contribution withdrawal must be made, at minimum, in
writing using the same communication mechanisms that were used to submit the
corresponding Contribution and must include the exact material being withdrawn.
Upon providing such valid notice, any obligations I incurred under this CLA for
that particular identified Contribution will be null and void.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:0in'>6. <u>Open Web Foundation Agreement (&quot;OWFa&quot;) version
1.0 Execution</u><span style='background:white'>. I acknowledge that the goal
of this CLA is to develop a specification that will be subject to the OWFa
version 1.0. While I have no legal obligation to execute the OWFa version 1.0
for any version of </span>the specification being developed under this CLA, I
agree that the selection and terms of the OWFa version 1.0 will not be subject
to negotiation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:0in'>7. <u>Antitrust Compliance</u>. I acknowledge <span
style='background:white'>that I may compete with other participants, that I am
under no obligation to implement the Specification, that each participant is
free to develop competing technologies and standards, and that each party is
free to license its patent rights to third parties, including for the purpose
of enabling competing technologies and standards.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:0in'>8. <u>Non-Circumvention</u>. I agree that I will not intentionally
take or willfully assist any third party to take any action for the purpose of
circumventing my obligations under this CLA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:0in'>9. <u>Representations, Warranties and Disclaimers</u>. I
represent and warrant that 1) I am legally entitled to grant the right<span
style='background:white'>s and promises set for</span>th in this CLA and 2) I
will not intentionally include any third party materials in any Contribution
unless those materials are available under terms that do not conflict with this
CLA. IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS MY CONTRIBUTIONS ARE PROVIDED &quot;AS IS.&quot; The
entire risk as to implementing or otherwise using the Contribution or the
Specification is assumed by the implementer and user. Except as stated herein,
I expressly disclaim any warranties (express, implied, or otherwise), including
implied warranties of merchantability, non-infringement, fitness for a
particular purpose, or title, related to the Contribution or the Specification.
IN NO EVENT WILL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY FOR LOST PROFITS OR ANY
FORM OF INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
CHARACTER FROM ANY CAUSES OF ACTION OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO THIS CLA,
WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE,
AND WHETHER OR NOT THE OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE. All of my obligations under Section 3 regarding the transfer,
successors in interest, or assignment of Granted Claims will be satisfied if I
notify the transferee or assignee of any patent that I know contains Granted
Claims of the obligations under Section 3. Nothing in this CLA requires me to
undertake a patent search. </p>

margin-left:.5in'>10.3. <u>Contribution</u>. “Contribution” means any original
work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing

claims that would be infringed by an implementation of the Specification if my
Contribution to that Specification were removed.</span></p>
